In 1961, on a cold November morning, Stanley Milgram, a young graduate student in psychology at Yale University, sat in his office and thought about a strange question. Just how far would regular people go to follow orders, even if it meant hurting other people? He didn't realize his interest would lead to one of social psychology's most controversial and important studies.

Milgram's experiment looked very easy, but it wasn't. They informed the participants that they were contributing to a study on learning and memory. They were told to give an actor (who was actually a learner) electric shocks for each wrong answer, with the power going up with each mistake. As the shocks got stronger, the learner would beg for forgiveness, say they were having heart problems, and then stop talking. A strict researcher in a lab coat would tell subjects to keep going if they paused.

The findings were shocking in every sense of the word. 65% of the subjects, despite the learner's apparent pain, followed instructions and administered what they believed to be potentially fatal 450-volt shocks [1]. This small act of respect showed something profound about people and the power of authority.

But what does Milgram's test tell us about how power and influence work in the present day? We need to look beyond psychology labs and into the world of leadership and organizational behavior to find the answer to this question.

Take a moment to think about Fidel Castro's strange baseball career. In 1947, Castro, who was still young, went to the US to try out for the Washington Senators football team. The team didn't think he was good enough to be a professional baseball player, so he became a politician instead [1]. This small rejection ignited a series of events that would transform global practices for decades to come.

At first glance, it might not seem like there is much of a link between Castro's failed baseball career and his rise to power. But both stories—Milgram's experiment and Castro's journey—show a basic truth about how people act: the systems of power around us have a big effect on what we do.

There is a debatable idea at the heart of Robert Greene's book *The 48 Laws of Power*. Greene says that having power isn't just having official authority; it also means knowing and controlling the psychological triggers that make people act in certain ways. One of these laws, "Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim," is similar to what Milgram's researcher did. He used his power to get people to follow the rules [5].

However, the application of these concepts extends beyond political shifts and psychological research. Power and influence work in subtle ways, and leaders who understand them can do amazing things in business.

Take the New Jersey Devils ice hockey team from 1994–1995 as an example. Despite their lackluster regular season record, they managed to defeat the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings and secure the Stanley Cup [2]. Not only did they have excellent skills and a excellent plan, but they also knew how to use the psychology of the loser to their advantage.

Jacques Lemaire, the Devils' coach, used many of Greene's rules of power very well. According to Law 27, Jacques Lemaire effectively leveraged people's belief to cultivate a cult-like following by fostering a strong sense of teamwork. When he hit his best in the playoffs, he mastered the art of timing (Law 35). And Law 9 says he won through actions, never through argument, because he let the team's play on the ice speak for itself.

This concept of capitalizing on a perceived loss extends beyond the realm of sports. Even though they've become industry giants, companies like Apple have long used the idea of being the underdog to keep customers loyal and keep workers motivated [8].

One of the best examples of the power of influence without official authority comes from Dr. Allan Cohen, who wrote the book *Influence Without Authority*. Cohen says that standard hierarchical power is often not enough in today's complicated business world. To be a successful leader, you need to learn how to influence others, which means persuasion, exchange, and finding common goals [5].

The change from official power to influence is a reflection of larger changes in our culture. In a world where organisations are becoming flatter and networks are spreading out, it's more important than ever to be able to lead without relying solely on rank power.

There is a theme that runs through all of these different cases, from Milgram's lab to Castro's baseball field, from the ice rink to the office. The best leaders understand power and impact's subtle dynamics. They know that having power isn't just about having a title; it's also about using the deep-seated human impulses that Milgram's studies showed and that Greene's rules write down.

In the end, being a successful leader today doesn't mean manipulating or forcing people to do what you want. It's about getting to know people's minds and using that information to inspire, drive, and lead others to the same goals. Understanding that true power lies not in controlling others, but in persuading them, is the key to success.

As we deal with the complicated world of modern leadership, we might find it helpful to remember that young graduate student at Yale who was thinking about what loyalty means. When we understand how authority affects people's behavior, we gain not only power but also responsibility—the duty to use our influence in a smart and moral way to help other people achieve their goals.
